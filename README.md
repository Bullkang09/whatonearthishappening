Minetest World Picnic

The folder named /gallery contains the Minetest Bucket World. 

Final Minetest is requiered you can download it at https://downloads.minetest.org/ )

Once you have Final Minetest copy the /gallery folder into the /worlds folder 
and the /gemalde folder into the /mods

Make sure you enable the gemalde mod before you start the game so that you don't open an empty gallery.

   Casimir for his mod gemalde
